# Travel-Planner-Model

Travel planning is essential in travel as it allows you to budget for your trip, think ahead about things to do, book restaurants and activities ahead of your visit so for doing all such planning, it takes a lot of hassle and bookkeeping. That is where “Travel Planner” comes in. To learn about where to go, what to do, and other travel-related information, we frequently search for travel blogs. We already have a list of items in our heads by the time we have looked at two to three pages.Important decisions we need to take are:

● At what time we will start the trip

● Under what radius do we want our destinations to be, could be a city?

● Our starting location

● In how many days will we be able to complete the whole trip optimally?

● How much time do we want to spend at a place?

This causes a lot of confusion, and we frequently put off planning and traveling as a result. To solve this dire issue, we are optimizing the travel itinerary based on the various parameters.

TravelPlanner is an optimization model, which would input the radius of the search area and the place address/postal code you want to visit, for how many days the visit would last, At what time you want to start your trip and from where? Based on this information we would provide the user with the number of places he can visit optimally in the given number of days while maximizing the rating.
